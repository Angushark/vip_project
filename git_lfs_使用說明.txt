Git LFS Usage Guide
===================

## [IMPORTANT] Must Do After Clone or Pull

After cloning the project or pulling latest code, LFS files may only be pointers (very small files).
You MUST run this command to download the actual large files:

   git lfs pull

This will download all actual large files (models, videos, etc.).
If your model files are only 100-200 bytes, you forgot to run this command!


## Daily Push Workflow (For Projects with LFS Already Set Up)

1. Check status
   git status

2. Add changed files
   git add .

3. Commit changes
   git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. Push to GitHub
   git push

That's it! LFS will automatically handle large files.


## Initial Git LFS Setup (New Project)

1. Install and initialize Git LFS
   git lfs install

2. Track file types (e.g., videos and model files)
   git lfs track "*.mp4"
   git lfs track "*.pt"
   git lfs track "*.avi"

3. Add .gitattributes file
   git add .gitattributes

4. Commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Enable Git LFS"
   git push


## Migrate Existing Large Files to LFS

If your project already has large files in commit history:

1. Set up LFS tracking first
   git lfs track "*.mp4"
   git lfs track "*.pt"

2. Migrate all large files from history
   git lfs migrate import --include="*.mp4,*.pt" --everything

3. Force push (because history was rewritten)
   git push --force


## Common Commands

View tracked file types:
   git lfs track

View files managed by LFS:
   git lfs ls-files

View LFS status:
   git lfs status

Download all LFS files:
   git lfs pull


## FAQ

Q: Model files are only 100-200 bytes and can't be used?
A: Run git lfs pull to download actual files

Q: Getting "file too large" error when pushing?
A: Make sure you ran git lfs track for that file type

Q: Models corrupted after clone?
A: Run git lfs pull to download actual LFS files


## Important Notes

1. Once LFS is set up, daily usage is the same as regular git
2. LFS files show as "Git LFS" pointers and don't take up local repo space
3. GitHub free accounts have LFS storage and bandwidth limits
4. Collaborators also need Git LFS installed to handle large files properly
5. Remember to run git lfs pull after clone or pull!


## LFS Tracked File Types in This Project

- *.mp4 (video files)
- *.pt (model files)
- *.avi (video files)

All files in models/ and videos/ directories are automatically managed by LFS.
